              My work with retail websites and analytics has meant gradual exposure to code through tracking tags and web content styling. I grew to be fascinated by the logic behind JavaScript which in turn inspired my curiosity in how tech affected user solutions. Iâ€™ve looked to develop my coding ability ever since!

              I was educated in the area of digital media and content writing for publication. Coming from a media background has helped me keep the way in which a message is delivered in mind when dealing with an audience. This approach aided my input in digital roles and I expanded my skills by delving into the creation of websites for content as well as SEO and analytical tools.
